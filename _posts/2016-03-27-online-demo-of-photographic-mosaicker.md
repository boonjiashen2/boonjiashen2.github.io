Recently I've been playing around with web development and it's been a lot of fun! Most of my work has been algorithmic development that's more or less silo-ed off to a corner of the world, but it seems to make sense from a societal perspective for the benefits of one's work to be shared as widely as possible, e.g., through the web.

To that end, I ported the photographic mosaicker (detailed in my previous post) over to Python and deployed it on a Heroku app. You can try mosaicking your own pictures [here](https://photomosaick.herokuapp.com/)!

Source code can be found on Github [[link](https://github.com/boonjiashen/heroku_simple_image_processing)].
